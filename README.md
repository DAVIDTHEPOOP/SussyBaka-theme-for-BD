# SussyBaka-theme-for-BD
Don't mind, its just to host some CSS. If you want you can still take it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

This is just the ClearVision theme that I modified a bit, you can find the original here : [ClearVision v6](https://github.com/ClearVision/ClearVision-v6).

There will be a weird .txt file, its in base64 so discord can access the CSS even offline (I know it stupid but who cares). Maybe I'll do the same for the images.
The not base64 CSS file will also be here !

The file named "SussyBaka_v1.theme.css" is the one to put in your "theme" folder.

And I'm more than bad at coding so I don't understand a single word of what's in those files :D
